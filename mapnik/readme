NOTE: layer order is defined in tilestache.cfg, not here.

mask_set1
• white outlined colors
-- create the background colors (parks, civic areas, ground)
-- get cut out of the ground (they have a white casing in the rendered images)
-- most roads with white casing...
-- implied road inline colors (or white)


mask_set2
• overlay colors
-- buildings
-- some roads that multiply into the background color (these are usually roads without casing)
-- water


style_base
-- these are subtracted out of backgrounds in both mask_set1 and mask_set2: water, buildings, etc.
-- casing for general roads (also see mask_set1)
-- casing for bridges at higher zooms
-- IMPORTANT!!!
-- you also need to modify the styles in MASK_SET1 to create the color inline part
